This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

You can add and comment on as many quotes as you like.
It is a basic app but if you want to implement something like DELETE, from the api folder you can implement the functions following the same logic of the mongodb documentation. The function is deleteOne. For the visual I use chakra-ui, I have used the most basic of the library as this is my first encounter with it.
